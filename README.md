##Spa & Salon Booking System 

"We have developed a comprehensive Spa & Salon Booking System with dedicated pages for both stylists and customers. 
Our system ensures a seamless booking experience, eliminating any scheduling conflicts to provide a smooth and efficient service."


#Key innovations:
No duplicate entries allowed.
Time constraints preventing immediate booking for a similar service.
Slot-specific restrictions (e.g., evening slot restriction after morning booking).
Booking details sent to customer via email.

Prevention of Duplicate Entries : Enhances experience with a streamlined, error-free booking by ensuring data accuracy. Improves efficiency, saving time for customers and staff, eliminating manual error correction in scheduling.
Time Constraints for Similar Services : Prioritizing customer satisfaction, a 45-minute gap between services ensures personalized attention, while optimized resource allocation fosters a balanced, efficient schedule.
Slot-Specific Restrictions : Enhances user experience by offering flexibility, maintaining fairness, and preventing inconveniences. Improves efficiency through optimal resource utilization for a seamless booking process.
